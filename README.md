# T3 Notes App

[ABANDONED] This is an app bootstrapped according to the [init.tips](https://init.tips) stack, also known as the T3-Stack.

It was a little side project to learn more about T3 stack. It was gonna be your typical To-Do C.R.U.D. web app, but dropped it in Admin User Management scenarios

## Things I'd like to implement if I hadn't abandoned it:

- download as excel

- testing

- add bcrypt to encrypt passwords

- add table order by clicking table head
